# get_string and print, with format strings

from cs50 import get_string

answer  = get_string("What's your name? ")
print(f"hello, {answer}")
# Notice how the curly braces allow for the print function to interpolate the answer such that answer appears within.
# The f is required to include the answer properly formatting.
